# MRI Reconstruction: Classical and Deep Learning Approaches

A comprehensive implementation of MRI reconstruction algorithms comparing classical compressed sensing methods with deep learning approaches. This project demonstrates end-to-end reconstruction pipelines suitable for research and clinical applications.

## Project Overview

Medical imaging, particularly MRI, often requires long acquisition times that can be reduced through undersampling techniques. However, undersampled data leads to artifacts that must be corrected through sophisticated reconstruction algorithms. This project implements and compares multiple reconstruction approaches:

- **Classical Methods**: FISTA (Fast Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm) with Total Variation regularization
- **Deep Learning**: U-Net architecture for learned reconstruction
- **Baseline**: Zero-filled reconstruction for comparison

The implementation includes synthetic data generation, comprehensive evaluation metrics, and a complete experimental pipeline for systematic comparison of reconstruction methods.

## Results and Benchmarks

### Expected Performance

Typical reconstruction quality (PSNR in dB) for 4x acceleration:

| Method | Shepp-Logan | Brain Phantom | Runtime (CPU) |
|--------|-------------|---------------|---------------|
| Zero-filled | 18-22 | 16-20 | <0.001s |
